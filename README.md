# AI-Powered Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an advanced data processing pipeline with a focus on technology-related content. It leverages the power of AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze, categorize, and extract insights from textual data.

## Features

- Text classification into predefined categories
- Keyword extraction for improved tagging and searchability
- Text summarization for quick content previews
- Technology-specific processing:
  - Tech-relatedness detection
  - Tech categorization
  - Sentiment analysis towards technology=
  - Key tech entities extraction
  - Tech-focused summary generation
  - Future impact prediction

## Components

### TxtAIClient

A client class that interfaces with the txtai API to perform various NLP tasks.

### BaseProcessor

The foundation for all data processors, implementing common NLP tasks.

### TechnologyProcessor

A specialized processor for technology-related content, building upon the BaseProcessor with tech-specific functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Aurite-ai/data-operations.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To use the TechnologyProcessor:

```python
from txtai.client import TxtAIClient
from data_processors.technology_processor import TechnologyProcessor

# Initialize the TxtAI client
txtai_client = TxtAIClient("http://your-txtai-api-url")

# Create a TechnologyProcessor instance
tech_processor = TechnologyProcessor(txtai_client)

# Process some data
data = {
    "title": "Advancements in AI",
    "text": "AI is revolutionizing various industries..."
}
processed_data = tech_processor.process(data)

print(processed_data)
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```
pytest tests/
```
